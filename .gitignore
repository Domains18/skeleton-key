# Test binary, generated with `go test -c`

# Output of the go build command
# For projects that produce a single binary, you might include the binary name
# For example: myapp
# If your project builds multiple binaries, you might use a pattern like:
# /bin/
# /out/
# Alternatively, you can explicitly list each binary name if they are known.

# Dependency directories (vendor)
# This is common if you are manually managing dependencies or using older Go versions.
# Modern Go modules typically handle dependencies within the module cache.
vendor/

# Go module cache
# This is usually located outside the project directory, but if you've configured it
# to be within the project, you might need to ignore it.
